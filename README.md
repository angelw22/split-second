# Split second
"Split Second" is an interactive sci-fi experience that flips the script on AI ethics debates. Instead of questioning what choices artificial intelligence might make, it asks: what would you choose? When you're thrust into the role of a malfunctioning autonomous vehicle's AI system and forced to make a split-second decision with limited information, the moral weight shifts from machine to human. This immersive piece explores who really bears the responsibility when impossible choices must be madeâ€”and challenges the assumption that humans would choose any better.
